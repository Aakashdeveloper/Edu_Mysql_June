Benefits:
> Reduce storage space
> Reduece insert,update and deletion 
> improve query performance


What is 1NF
> No Repeated rows of data
> Colums only Conatins a single value
> The table has a primary key

What is 2NF
> They conform to 1NF
> Every column that is not a primary key of the table is 
  dependent on the whole of the primary key

What is 3NF
> They conform to 2NF
> Every column that is not a primary key  is only
  dependent on the whole of the primary key
